Intro

For this task we will use free API that offers the list of countries: https://restcountries.eu/#api-endpoints-all
You can find there the documentation along with available HTTP endpoints and sample responses.

Functionalities

The goal is to write an application that will communicate with this API and have following functionalities:


Display the table with all countries with following columns: name, currency, language, population, area, flag


Allow to sort by every column (except flag) with ascending / descending order


Add a searchbox so user can filter table by values in all columns (except flag)


Add two optional inputs: min_population and max_population where user can search for countries that have population in a given range


Create separate "dashboard" page and display:
a) total number of countries
b) top 5 most common languages
c) top 5 most common currencies
d) avg population
e) avg area
f) avg number of neigbours



Requirements


The application should be written in VanillaJS. Do not use any frameworks, we want to test your JS knowledge.


Do not use libraries (e.g. Bootstrap) for styling. You can use CSS/SCSS/SASS.


We do not expect the app to look outstanding, but we want to see your styling skills.


The application should be responsive to all resolutions.
